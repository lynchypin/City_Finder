## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Google Gemini API Key:** You'll need an API key from Google to use the core AI features.
2.  **(Optional) OpenAI API Key:** If you want to use the "Retry with OpenAI" feature, you'll need an API key from OpenAI.
3.  **A Google Sheet with Client Data:** This sheet will be the source of your client list.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Prepare Your Google Sheet

- Create a new Google Sheet.
- Your sheet **must** contain the following columns (headers can be in any order):
  - `Client first name`
  - `Client second name`
  - `Job Title`
  - `Company`
- **CRITICAL:** You must update the sharing permissions.
  - Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner.
  - Under "General access," change "Restricted" to **"Anyone with the link"**.
  - Ensure the role is set to **"Viewer"**. This is necessary for the application to read the data.
- Copy the **Sheet ID** from your browser's URL bar. It's the long string of random characters in the middle of the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`[THIS_IS_THE_SHEET_ID]`**`/edit`

#### 2. Get Your API Keys

- **Google Gemini:** Visit [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your free API key.
- **OpenAI (Optional):** Visit the [**OpenAI Platform**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create an API key if you don't already have one.

#### 3. Run the Application

- Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
- You will be greeted with a setup screen.
- Enter your **Gemini API Key** and your **Google Sheet ID**.
- If you have one, enter your **OpenAI API Key** in the optional field.
- Click **"Save Settings & Start"**.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Loading Data:** The application will automatically fetch and display the clients from your Google Sheet.
2.  **Finding Cities & Titles:**
    - Click **`Find All (Gemini)`** to start the primary research process. The app will process all clients that don't yet have a city in batches.
    - If you provided an OpenAI key, you can use **`Find All (OpenAI)`** as an alternative primary search.
    - If some clients result in an error or are marked as "Not Found," the **`Retry Failed with OpenAI`** button will appear. This is a powerful feature that uses a different AI model to find difficult-to-locate contacts.
3.  **Review and Edit:**
    - As results come in, they will populate the "Identified City" and "Job Title" columns.
    - You can click into any "Identified City" cell to make manual corrections. Changes are saved automatically.
4.  **Downloading Results:**
    - Once you're satisfied with the enriched list, click **`Download CSV`**. This will save a `client_locations.csv` file to your computer with all the updated information.
